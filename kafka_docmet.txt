download sdk (as kafka is written in java so it needs jdk)
single node kafka cluster
download any version of kafka from its official website(I downloaded 2.0.0 binary download scala 2.12) 
uncompress it two times (I moved the extracted file to C drive but it is optional as we will save the invironment veriable for the same)
open \config\zookeeper.properties and change the "DataDir=/temp/zookeeper" location to a new location which u have created now. 
then open server.properties 1.change "log.dirs=/tmp../.." to new kafkalog file which needs to be created in kafka final extracted file 
			    2.under internaltopics settings add-> offsets.topic.num.partitions=1
			    3.add->  min.insync.replicas=1
			    4.add->  default.replication.factor=1

under kafka bin directory there is a windows directory this contains files(.bat) which are tools of kafka (it is advised to add its path  in path veriable).


kafka needs zookeeper to start so we first need to run zookeeper use terminal to execute 
-> zookeeper-server-start.bat (location of \zookeeper.properties without parenthesis)

after running the server open next terminal for kafka server
-> kafka-server-start.bat (location of \server.properties without parenthesis).
            let them run is there respective window


to create new Topic-
-> kafka-topics.bat --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic test 

to start a producer-
->kafka-console-producer.bat --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic test

to  see cosumer's data-
kafka-console-consumer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic test --from-beginning
 
to check the list if broker ids-
-> zookeeper-shell.bat localhost:2181 ls /roker/ids
